# Discovered Components

This is an auto-generated list of components discovered by [nuxt/components](https://github.com/nuxt/components).

You can directly use them in pages and other components without the need to import them.

**Tip:** If a component is conditionally rendered with `v-if` and is big, it is better to use `Lazy` or `lazy-` prefix to lazy load.

- `<PokemonCard>` | `<pokemon-card>` (components/PokemonCard.vue)
- `<PokemonList>` | `<pokemon-list>` (components/PokemonList.vue)
- `<SearchBar>` | `<search-bar>` (components/SearchBar.vue)
